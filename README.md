This is a simple Music UI that interacts with a local SQLite3 database on the machine,
it displays a list of artists from a database file and allows you to view the albums for a selected artist.
Made with Java, JavaFX, FXML, and SQLite3. This was made during an online course with a few addition additions,
that i added to prevent crashes in the event nothing was selected when the show ablums button was pressed.
